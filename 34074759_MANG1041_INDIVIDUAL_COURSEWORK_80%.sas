 /*The aim of this program is to analyse data on amphibians at 189 sites surrounding two planned motorways in Poland. This includes importing the excel file into SAS,
summarising the number of sites each species has been observed, creating new variables that describe the data set. There are also descriptive statistics such as
frequency tables and correlation coefficients, as well as a logistic regression model to determine the probability of a site being rich in amphibians. Finally,
a report that displays the sites that are richest in amphibians. */

/* Q1. I am importing the excel file 'amphibians.xlsx' into sas and identify what type of database this file is using the 'dbms'command,
as it is an XLSX file using the PROC step */

/* Q2. I am summing the number of sites that each species has been observed using the 'means' command, as well as telling sas 'noprint' as I am only interested in retrieving
the sum. I am also specifying the variables of all the frog species using the 'var' command, as well as summing the number each species was observed
using the 'sum' command, and creating it as a seperate sheet called 'Number_Of_Species_Observed' and titling it using the 'title' command, all while using the PROC step */

/*Q3. Through this print procedure, I can deduce that the species most often observed is 'Brown_frogs' with 148 observations */
/*Q4. This print procedure can also allow me to deduce that the species least often observed is 'Great_crested_newt' with 21 observations */
/*Q5. I am using the 'set' command to ensure that this new variable is created in the original amphibians file, after this, I use the  'sum' command to create a new 
variable that is the sum of all the seven different species, and giving it an easy to read label using the 'label' command using the DATA step*/

/*Q6. I am using the 'proc freq' procedure to produce a table displaying the frequencies, this is done by using the 'tables' statement to produce a frequency list
of all values of the variable species, by motorway, using the '*' notation to allow this, to make the frequency table easier to read, I am supressing unneeded 
results such as col and percent using the statements 'nocol' and 'nopercent' respectively*/

/*Q9. Here I add the variable 'rich_site' in the data set 'amphibians' by using the 'if, then' statement to classify rich_site as a value of 1 when the variable
'species' is greater than 3, and using the 'else' statement to allow the variable 'rich_site' to take a value of 0 otherwise using the DATA step*/

as that is the frequency of the value '1' for the variable 'rich_site' which suggests the site is rich in amphibians as it has
more than 3 amphibians */

and its strength is moderate. */
/*Q14. Here I use the proc logistic statement in the data set 'amphibians', I use the 'model' statement without the 'class' statement as all the independent
variables are numerical data and not categorical, with rich_site on the left-hand site of the equality as it is the dependent variable, here I also use the 'event'
statement to show the probability that the variables 'NR,SR,FR,RR' can predict the variable 'rich_site' */

/*Q15. Through the proc logistic procedure used in Q14, this logistic regression model has a C-statistic of 0.661, this suggests the model is not much better
at classifying which sites are rich in amphibians or not than random chance as, a value closer to 1 will suggest a better logistic regression model */
/*Q16. Here I use the proc print procedure to print a results table from the data set 'amphibians' where the Total number of different species in a given site,
is greater or equal to 6, using the 'where' command and only include the variables 'ID' 'Motorway' and the 7 amphibian species using the 'var' command, also, to
ensure the observation number coloumn is suppressed, I use the command 'noobs'*/
